   - Records individual views in craft_views table
   - Prevents duplicate views per user

2. **`saveCraft(craftId, userId)`**
   - Adds craft to user's saved items
   - Increments save_count
   - Prevents duplicate saves

3. **`unsaveCraft(craftId, userId)`**
   - Removes from saved items
   - Decrements save_count safely (GREATEST function)

4. **`isCraftSaved(craftId, userId)`**
   - Checks if user has saved a craft

#### **Controller Layer** (`craftController.js`)
✅ **Updated Existing Endpoints**
- `POST /api/crafts` - Create craft with new fields

✅ **New Endpoints Added**
1. **`POST /api/crafts/:id/view`** (Public)
   - Track craft views
   - Optional authentication

2. **`POST /api/crafts/:id/save`** (Private)
   - Save/bookmark a craft

   - Check if craft is saved by user

5. **`GET /api/crafts/artisan/stats`** (Private - Artisan only)
   - Get artisan dashboard statistics

#### **Routes** (`craftRoutes.js`)
✅ **Updated route structure with comments**
```javascript
// Public routes
GET  /api/crafts              // Get all approved crafts
GET  /api/crafts/:id          // Get single craft

// Artisan craft management
