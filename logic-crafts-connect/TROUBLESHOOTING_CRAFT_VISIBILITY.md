## 🎯 Why It Wasn't Showing Before

The craft was uploaded with status **"pending"** and needed admin approval before becoming visible to buyers.

### The Workflow:
```
1. Artisan uploads craft → Status: "pending" ❌ Not visible
2. Admin approves craft → Status: "approved" ✅ Now visible
3. Buyers can see craft on Home, Dashboard, Explore pages
```

## 🐛 Fixed Issues

### 1. Recommendations API Error (500)
**Problem**: The `/api/recommendations/personalized` endpoint was failing

**Solution**: Updated `BuyerDashboard.jsx` to handle recommendation errors gracefully:
```javascript
// Now it catches errors and continues loading other data
try {
  const recommendationsRes = await axios.get(...);
  setRecommendations(recommendationsRes.data.data.recommendations || []);
} catch (recError) {
  console.log('Recommendations not available, using crafts instead');
  setRecommendations([]);
}
```

### 2. Craft Status
**Problem**: Craft was uploaded as "pending"

**Solution**: Ran approval script to change status to "approved"
```sql
UPDATE crafts SET status = 'approved' WHERE status = 'pending'
```
