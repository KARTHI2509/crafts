# Complete Craft Visibility Workflow Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the craft visibility workflow for Logic Craft Connect, ensuring that when an artisan uploads a craft, it automatically appears in all required locations with full filtering, search, and pagination capabilities.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Visibility on Upload
- Crafts are immediately visible to all users (public and buyers) upon upload
- No admin approval required for instant visibility
- Crafts are set to `status: 'approved'` and `visibility: 'public'` by default

### 2. Multi-Location Display
- **Public Page**: Visible to all visitors (logged-in and guests)
- **Buyer Dashboard**: Visible in "Available Crafts" section
- **Explore Page**: Full catalog with advanced filtering

### 3. Artisan Control Panel
- Artisans can hide/show their crafts
- Manage all uploaded crafts with status tracking
- Edit and delete functionality

### 4. Advanced Filtering & Search
- Filter by category, artisan, location, price range
- Full-text search across crafts and artisans
- Verified crafts filter

### 5. Pagination & Performance
- Efficient pagination for large craft collections
- Optimized database queries with indexes
- Fast loading times even with thousands of crafts

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### Database Schema Enhancement
```sql
-- Added visibility field to crafts table
ALTER TABLE crafts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS visibility VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'public' 
CHECK (visibility IN ('public', 'hidden'));

-- Added indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_crafts_visibility ON crafts(visibility);
```

#### API Endpoints
1. **`POST /api/crafts`** - Create craft with default visibility
2. **`PATCH /api/crafts/:id/visibility`** - Toggle craft visibility
3. **`GET /api/crafts`** - Get all approved, public crafts with pagination
4. **`GET /api/crafts/my-crafts`** - Get artisan's own crafts

#### Model Functions
- `toggleCraftVisibility(id, userId, visibility)` - Toggle craft visibility
- `getAllCrafts(limit, offset)` - Get paginated crafts
- `getCraftsCount()` - Get total craft count

### Frontend Changes
