# Artisan Craft Visibility Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the feature that displays crafts uploaded by artisans to all buyers on the Home page and Buyer Dashboard.

## Implementation Summary

### 📋 What Was Implemented

When an artisan uploads a craft through the "Upload Craft" page, it now:
1. **Saves to Database** - The craft is stored in the database with status "pending"
2. **Shows After Admin Approval** - Once admin approves (status = "approved"), it becomes visible to all buyers
3. **Displays on Multiple Pages**:
   - **Home Page** - Featured crafts section showing latest 6 crafts
   - **Buyer Dashboard** - "Browse Available Crafts" section showing latest 8 crafts
   - **Explore Page** - All approved crafts with filtering options

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Image Storage**: Currently uses base64 encoded images. For production, implement proper cloud storage.
2. **Performance**: Loading all crafts at once may slow down with large datasets. Implement pagination.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Crafts don't auto-refresh. Users need to reload page to see new crafts.
