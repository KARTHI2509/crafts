## 🔍 Why Explore is Hidden from Artisans

### Reasons:

1. **Focus on Creation**
   - Artisans should upload, not browse
   - Prevents distraction from core task

2. **Business Model Clarity**
   - Supply side (artisans) ≠ Demand side (buyers)
   - Clear separation of roles

3. **Workflow Efficiency**
   - Upload → Manage → Analytics
   - Not: Browse → Upload → Browse → Manage

4. **UX Best Practices**
   - Don't show features users don't need
   - Cleaner, more focused interface

5. **Performance**
   - Artisans don't load explore data
