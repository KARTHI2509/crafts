# 🔧 Buyer Role Registration Fix

## 🔴 Problem Identified

**Issue:** When registering as a **Buyer**, the user was being saved as an **Artisan** in the database.

**Root Cause:** The backend `authController.js` was not extracting the `role` field from the request body.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **`backend/controllers/authController.js`**

**Before:**
```javascript
const { name, email, password, phone, location } = req.body;
// ❌ role field was missing!

const user = await createUser({
  name,
  email,
  password: hashedPassword,
  phone,
  location
  // ❌ role not passed to createUser
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { name, email, password, phone, location, role } = req.body;
// ✅ Now extracting role

// Validate role if provided
const validRoles = ['artisan', 'buyer', 'admin'];
if (role && !validRoles.includes(role)) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Invalid role. Must be artisan, buyer, or admin'
  });
}

const user = await createUser({
  name,
  email,
  password: hashedPassword,
  phone,
  location,
  role: role || 'artisan'  // ✅ Pass role to createUser
});
```

#### 2. **`frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx`**

Added debugging logs to verify role is being sent:

```javascript
// Debug log
console.log('Registering with role:', registrationData.role);
console.log('Full registration data:', registrationData);
```

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

If role is still not working:

### 1. Check Backend Console
Look for the registration request:
```
POST /api/auth/register - [timestamp]
```

### 2. Check Request Data
In backend, add temporary log:
```javascript
console.log('Received registration data:', req.body);
console.log('Role received:', req.body.role);
```

### 3. Check Frontend Console (F12)
Should see:
```
Registering with role: buyer  (or artisan)
Full registration data: {...role: "buyer"...}
```

### 4. Check Database
```sql
-- See all users and their roles
SELECT id, name, email, role, created_at 
FROM users 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### 5. Clear Old Test Data
If you have old test users:
```sql
-- Delete test users (CAREFUL!)
DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%test.com';
```
