## 💡 Recommendation

**I recommend proceeding with Phase 4** to complete the full backend feature set before moving to frontend, ensuring a robust API foundation for the React components.

Alternatively, we can **start frontend implementation** now with the existing 33 endpoints to deliver a working buyer experience faster.

**What would you like to do next?**
1. Phase 4 - Wishlist & Recommendations Backend
2. Start Frontend Implementation
3. Test existing features first
